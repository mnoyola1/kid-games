## Tips for Math Quest Visual Style:

1. **Educational Theme**: Incorporate mathematical symbols naturally into fantasy elements
2. **Color Coding**: Use consistent colors for different operations/difficulty levels
3. **Encouraging Atmosphere**: Even "enemies" should feel like learning challenges, not threats
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Visual complexity should increase with game difficulty
5. **Clear Feedback**: Success and error states must be immediately recognizable
6. **RPG Conventions**: Follow classic RPG visual language for familiarity
