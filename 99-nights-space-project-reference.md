# PART 1: SOURCE INSPIRATION

## 99 Nights in the Forest (Roblox Game)

### Core Mechanics
- **Survival gameplay**: Survive 99 days/nights
- **Base defense**: Maintain campfire (core survival mechanic)
- **Enemy threat**: "The Deer" - primary antagonist that hunts at night
- **Rescue mission**: Find and rescue 4 missing children
- **Combat**: Fight cultists and hostile creatures
- **Exploration**: Multiple biomes (forest, snow, volcano)
- **Multiplayer**: 1-5 players, difficulty scales with team size
- **Progression**: Classes, animal taming, base building

### Visual Style
- Full 3D with third-person camera
- Atmospheric lighting, fog, dynamic shadows
- Large explorable terrain
- Day/night cycle with dramatic lighting changes
- Horror atmosphere (spooky but not gory - kid-appropriate)

### Success Metrics
- Built in 3 months
- Reached 14M peak concurrent users
- Developer: Grandma's Favourite Games

# PART 2: SPACE TRANSLATION CONCEPT

## "99 Nights in Space" - Mechanic Mapping

| Forest Original | Space Equivalent | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Campfire | Oxygen generator / Life support | Must keep powered or die |
| The Deer | Alien entity / Corrupted astronaut | Primary threat during "dark shifts" |
| Forest biome | Space station / Asteroid base | Starting area |
| Snow biome | Zero-G sector | Different movement mechanics |
| Volcano biome | Infested sector | High danger, high reward |
| Missing children | Missing crew members | 4 to rescue |
| Cultists | Space cultists / Corrupted survivors | Secondary enemies |
| Day/night | Shift rotations / Power cycles | "Light shift" vs "Dark shift" |
| Wood/resources | Scrap metal, power cells, oxygen canisters | Gathering loop |
| Animal taming | Robot companions? | Optional feature |

## Thematic Elements
- Isolation and claustrophobia of space
- Oxygen as constant pressure (replaces warmth/fire)
- Alien threat that hunts during power outages
- Mystery: What happened to the station? Where is the crew?
- Escape goal: Survive 99 shifts until rescue arrives

# PART 3: TECHNICAL STACK DECISION

## Recommended Stack

| Component | Choice | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **3D Engine** | **Babylon.js** | Full game engine (not just renderer), built-in physics, collision detection, animation system, great documentation, Claude/Cursor knows it well |
| **Multiplayer** | **Colyseus** | Node.js game server, designed for real-time games, automatic state synchronization, matchmaking, free & open source |
| **Client Hosting** | Vercel | Already using for Noyola Hub, static files |
| **Server Hosting** | Railway or Render | Free tier sufficient for family use, easy Node.js deployment |
| **3D Assets** | Sketchfab, Quaternius, Mixamo | Free/cheap sci-fi assets available |

## Why Babylon.js Over Alternatives

| Engine | Verdict | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Babylon.js** | ✅ RECOMMENDED | Full game engine, built-in physics, great docs, Microsoft-backed |
| Three.js | ❌ | Rendering library only - need to build game systems yourself |
| PlayCanvas | 🟡 Maybe | Cloud-based editor, good but less Claude familiarity |
| A-Frame | ❌ | VR-focused, too simple for this project |
| Phaser | ❌ | 2D only |

## Why Colyseus for Multiplayer

- Open source, MIT license
- Node.js based (JavaScript - same ecosystem)
- Built-in state synchronization (delta compression)
- Room-based architecture (perfect for family sessions)
- Authoritative server (prevents cheating)
- Well-documented, active community
- Free self-hosting, or Colyseus Cloud for managed hosting

# PART 6: COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

## Comparison to Existing Projects

| Project | Complexity | Time to Build | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Canada Adventure (original) | Low | Days | Single-file React game |
| Canada Adventure (pixel) | Low-Medium | Days | Added pixel art sprites |
| Spell Siege | Medium | Week | Tower defense mechanics |
| Lumina Racer | Medium | Week | Racing game |
| **99 Nights in Space** | **High** | **Months** | Full 3D, multiplayer, AI |
| Shadows in the Halls | High | Months | Similar scope |

## Reality Check (Updated with Progress)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Is this feasible? | ✅ **PROVEN** - Playable prototype exists |
| Complexity vs current work | 🟡 Manageable with modular approach |
| Time to playable prototype | ✅ **DONE** - Core mechanics working |
| Time to "finished" game | 2-4 months remaining |
| Can Cursor + Claude help? | ✅ **PROVEN** - Built entire prototype |
| Will it match 99 Nights exactly? | 🟡 Getting closer with each iteration |
| Multiplayer adds complexity | 🔴 Still significant - future phase |

## Skills Learned During Development

- ✅ Babylon.js scene setup and rendering
- ✅ glTF/OBJ model loading and texturing
- ✅ ArcRotateCamera configuration
- ✅ Raycasting for visibility checks
- ✅ Web Audio API for procedural sound
- ✅ Touch control implementation
- ✅ Game state management
- ✅ Two-floor system (collision vs visual)
- 📋 WebSocket/Colyseus (planned)
- 📋 Authoritative server architecture (planned)

## IMPORTANT: Two-Floor Architecture

**This game uses TWO separate floor layers:**

| Floor Type | Technology | Y Position | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Collision Floor | `CreateGround` | Y=0 | Invisible, handles physics |
| Visual Floor | `Platform_Metal.gltf` | Y=0.05+ | What player sees |

**Key Points:**
- The visual glTF floor tiles have thickness - their TOP SURFACE is around Y=0.4
- Player positioning (`GROUND_Y` constant) must be based on the VISUAL floor, not collision floor
- `GROUND_Y = 2.5` positions the player correctly on the visual floor
- If player appears to sink or float, adjust `GROUND_Y` - do NOT change based on collision floor

**Why This Matters:**
- Previous debugging spent significant time because player was positioned relative to collision floor (Y=0) instead of visual floor (Y=0.4+)
- Always reference the visual floor when adjusting player/NPC heights

---

# PART 8: NEXT STEPS

## Recommended Next Features (Priority Order)

1. **Crafting System** - Workbench UI, basic recipes for tools/barriers
2. **Flashlight Mechanic** - Limited battery, crucial during Lights Off
3. **More Enemy Types** - Void Hounds (pack hunters), Cargo Beasts (tanky)
4. **First Crew Rescue** - NPC escort mission in Sector 2
5. **Save/Load System** - Persist progress between sessions
6. **Additional Sectors** - Engineering, Research Labs

## Technical Debt to Address

1. Split `game-main.js` into separate system modules (it's 1400+ lines)
2. Add proper loading screen with progress bar
3. Implement pause menu with settings
4. Add minimap for navigation

## Questions for Future Development

1. Should multiplayer be authoritative server or P2P?
2. Add procedural level generation or hand-crafted maps?
3. Implement inventory UI or keep simple auto-collection?

# PART 9: INTEGRATION WITH NOYOLA HUB

## LuminaCore Connection Points

Once the game is playable, integrate with existing progression:

```javascript
// On game milestones
LuminaCore.addXP(100, 'space-nights');        // Survived a shift
LuminaCore.addXP(500, 'space-nights');        // Rescued crew member
LuminaCore.addCoins(50, 'space-nights');      // Per shift survived

// Achievements
LuminaCore.awardAchievement('sn_first_shift');    // Survive first shift
LuminaCore.awardAchievement('sn_first_rescue');   // Rescue first crew
LuminaCore.awardAchievement('sn_all_crew');       // Rescue all 4 crew
LuminaCore.awardAchievement('sn_night_99');       // Complete the game!

// Session tracking
LuminaCore.recordGameSession('space-nights', {
  shiftsCompleted: 15,
  crewRescued: 2,
  playersInSession: 3
});
```

---

# APPENDIX: ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES CONSIDERED

## Option A: Roblox Development (Rejected)
- **Pro**: Same platform as 99 Nights, established audience
- **Con**: Different tech stack (Lua), can't integrate with Noyola Hub, learning curve
- **Verdict**: User wants web-based, Hub integration

## Option B: 2D Top-Down Version (Simpler Alternative)
- **Pro**: Much faster to build, Phaser.js, existing skills transfer
- **Con**: Doesn't match 99 Nights visual style, less immersive
- **Verdict**: User specifically wants 3D like the original

## Option C: Unity/Unreal WebGL Export
- **Pro**: Professional game engines, more tutorials
- **Con**: Heavy downloads, slower iteration, overkill for scope
- **Verdict**: Babylon.js is lighter and web-native
