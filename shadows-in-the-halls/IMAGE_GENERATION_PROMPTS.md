## Tips for Shadows in the Halls Visual Style:

1. **Atmospheric Not Graphic**: Dark and tense but never gory or explicitly scary
2. **Lighting is Key**: Contrast between light and dark creates tension
3. **Top-Down Clarity**: Player must always see character clearly
4. **Enemy Visibility**: Shadows should be spooky but clearly visible in light
5. **Educational Balance**: Puzzles provide "safe moments" in tense atmosphere
6. **Kid-Appropriate**: Mystery and tension without nightmare fuel

## Color Palette:

- **Primary Darkness**: Very dark blue (#0A0E27), not pure black
- **Flashlight**: Warm yellow-white (#FFF9E3)
- **Shadows/Enemies**: Purple-black (#2D1B4E) with red accents (#8B0000)
- **Safe Areas**: Warm orange-amber (#FF8C42)
- **UI Elements**: Cyan (#00D9FF) for visibility
- **Memory Fragments**: Ethereal blue-white (#A0D8FF)

## Atmosphere Notes:

**The goal is "Scooby-Doo Scary" not "Horror Movie Scary":**
- Mysterious and tense but solvable
- Spooky but not traumatizing
- Educational moments provide relief
- Safe rooms offer genuine comfort
- Victory feels earned and relieving

Generate all assets with this age-appropriate balance in mind.
