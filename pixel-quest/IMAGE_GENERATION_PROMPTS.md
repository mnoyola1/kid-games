3. **Depth Layers**: Use parallax scrolling with multiple background layers
4. **Readable Action**: All interactive elements must be immediately recognizable
5. **Color Coding**: Each world has distinct color palette for instant recognition
6. **Collectible Appeal**: Items should look rewarding to collect

## Color Palettes by World:

- **Math World**: Blue (#2196F3), Green (#4CAF50), White (#FFFFFF)
- **Science World**: Purple (#9C27B0), Cyan (#00BCD4), Lime (#CDDC39)
- **History World**: Brown (#795548), Gold (#FFC107), Sepia (#8D6E63)
- **Language World**: Red (#F44336), Cream (#FFF9C4), Brown (#6D4C41)
- **Final Challenge**: Rainbow - All colors combined

## Tileset Requirements:

For each world, create:
1. Solid ground tile (32x32px)
2. Left edge tile
3. Right edge tile
4. Top surface tile
5. Interior fill tile
6. Corner tiles (4 directions)
7. Slope tiles (up/down)
8. Background wall tiles

All tiles must be seamlessly tileable for level construction.
