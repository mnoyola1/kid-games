## Tips for Using These Prompts in Gemini:

1. **Consistency**: Use the same style descriptor across all assets (e.g., "16-bit pixel art")
2. **Iteration**: Generate multiple versions and select the best
3. **Transparency**: Always request "transparent background" for sprites
4. **Size**: Specify exact dimensions for consistency
5. **Color Palette**: Keep purple, gold, and blue as the primary magical color scheme
6. **Post-Processing**: Use the remove_bg.py tool if backgrounds aren't transparent

## Animation Notes:

For animated sprites, generate 3-5 frames:
1. Idle/standing pose
2. Walking/movement pose 1
3. Walking/movement pose 2
4. Attack/action pose
5. Hurt/damaged pose

Generate each frame separately with clear pose descriptions.
